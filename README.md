# Chartel — Tiny Diagramming Tool That Dreamed Big 📐

An experimental browser diagramming playground where I tried to build a mini visual editor with draggable shapes, connectors, and graph logic — using plain JavaScript and D3.

This was a “what if I just build my own diagramming tool?” moment — and I followed the curiosity.

> Built in the pre-AI era — every bug handcrafted.
> Learned the DOM the old-fashioned way: by poking it until it moved.
> If I only knew about frameworks at this point! :)

## What It Does

- Adds draggable canvas elements (squares, rhombuses, icons)
- Lets you move elements around freely
- Experiments with node/link graph behavior using D3
- Prototypes basic visual-editor interactions
